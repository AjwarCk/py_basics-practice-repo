    "Encapsulation and abstraction are two fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that help in designing robust, maintainable and resusable codes. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, while abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features.
